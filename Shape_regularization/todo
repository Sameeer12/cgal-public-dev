* Refactor the solvers. Now when adding a custom user-defined solver, the QP main class does not see an overload of the solve() function.
Moreover, the solver concept anyway requires the reserve() function to be efficient for the OSQP solver. When adding the concept, I should 
probably put it in the Solver_interface and refactor the MixedIntegerConcept, too.
