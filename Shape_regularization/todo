* When adding the QP_solver concept, I should probably put it in the Solver_interface 
and refactor the MixedIntegerConcept, too.
* Redo the Parallel_segments_2 class. Now it is not precise enough! Remove key_angle_2().
* Redo the 100_segments_offsets example and test. Current generation is weird.
* Should I remove Parallel_groups_2 class from the Collinear and Orthogonal classes?
* Add contour tests.
* Clean regularize_planes(), tests, and examples.
