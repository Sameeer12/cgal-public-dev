* Add benchmarks.
* Remove all unnecessary functions.
* Improve the contour base algorithm.
* Install OSQP on all testing platforms.
* When adding the QP_solver concept, I should put it in the Solver_interface and refactor the MixedIntegerConcept, too.
* Check the closed/open contour generating examples. They should avoid an almost collinear vertex in the left top corner.
* test_open_contour does not perform well.
